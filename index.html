            <p>Paris 2024 transformed the most iconic landmarks in the City of Light into sporting arenas, the likes the
              world has never seen before. From the beach volleyball competition nestled beside the Eiffel Tower to
              equestrian at the Chateau de Versailles and fencing in the Grand Palais, many of the most well-loved
              locations in Paris became centres of Olympic sports competition as millions in attendance witnessed the
              capital of France in a new and unforgettable way. <br><br>In line with its slogan, ‘Games Wide Open’,
              Paris
              2024 was the first Olympic Games in history to achieve gender parity on the field of play. Of the 10,500
              quotas available to athletes, the International Olympic Committee distributed an equal number to female
              and male athletes. At the same time, the Opening Ceremony saw 96 per cent of National Olympic Committees
              choose two athletes - one female and one male - to carry their respective countries' flags.

              Furthermore, 28 out of 32 sports reached full gender parity during the Games, with more than half of all
              medal events at Paris 2024 open to female athletes.</p>

          Filipino Athletes in Paris Olympics
        </div>

    <div class="row">

        <div class="h6 mb-5">The 2024 Paris Olympics marked a historic milestone for the Philippines. In the nation’s 23rd
          year of participation, gymnast Carlos Yulo brought home two gold medals, while boxers Aira Villegas and Nesthy
          Petecio each secured bronze. The years of relentless training and preparation culminated in these victories,
          but beyond the excitement, the competition showed the mental resilience displayed by Filipino athletes.
          “Compared to other countries, we were greatly outnumbered,” Cavite 8th district Representative Aniela
          Tolentino observed. “But that didn’t intimidate or bother them.”<br><br>

          There was a sense of unity that radiated from every corner of the Olympic venue. “One of the most heartwarming
          moments was seeing Filipino spectators, who were strangers to each other, come together in a display of
          unity,” she recalls. “Despite not knowing one another, we all rallied around our athletes with a shared sense
          of pride and enthusiasm. I remember meeting a Filipino couple from Paris who noticed I didn’t have a flag and
          handed me one. We instantly became friends. It was a powerful reminder of how sports can foster a sense of
          belonging and togetherness.”<br><br>

          One of the highlights of the event was undoubtedly Yulo’s triumph in the Men’s Vault Finals. “As our national
          anthem played and the Philippine flag was raised, I felt tears streaming down my face and goosebumps on my
          skin,” Tolentino shares. “It was an incredible moment, one I will cherish forever.” Tolentino also gained deep
          insights from her time with the athletes, including the importance of mental resilience. <i>- Vogue
